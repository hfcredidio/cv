My Curriculum Vitae
-------------------

This is the respository for the source code of my curriculum vitae,
which I did in Jade, Jinja2, HTML, and CSS as a little exercise.

Requirements
------------

A fairly modern python (preferably 3, but should work with 2),
pyjade, jinja2.

TODO
----
Make it reponsive so I can put it online (probably not gonna happen).
